To run this example, you will need to install twisted.

Run: `sudo easy_install twisted`  
then run: `python hello.py`  
finally open `http://localhost:8080/World` on your browser. 

Replace World for something else and see what happens.

Note: twisted requires Python sources, which must be installed using `sudo apt-get install python-dev`
